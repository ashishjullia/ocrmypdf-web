If input\_file is "-", standard input will be read. output\_file – If a pathlib.Path, str or bytes, this is interpreted as file system path to the output file. If the object appears to be a writable stream (with methods such as .write() and .seek()), the output will be written to this stream.

How can I fit this in a Flask app that serves this as an API

1 / 1

To fit this function into a Flask app that serves it as an API, you can define a Flask route that accepts the necessary parameters as inputs and returns the output file. Here's an example:

python

```python
from flask import Flask, request, send_file
from ocrmypdf import ocr
from tempfile import NamedTemporaryFile

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/ocrmypdf', methods=['POST'])
def ocrmypdf_api():
    input_file = request.files['file']
    language = request.form.getlist('language')
    output_type = request.form.get('output_type')
    # ... and so on for all the other parameters

    with NamedTemporaryFile(suffix='.pdf', delete=False) as tmp_file:
        # Save the uploaded file to the temporary file
        input_file.save(tmp_file)
        tmp_file.close()

        with NamedTemporaryFile(suffix='.pdf', delete=False) as output_file:
            # Call the OCR function with the given parameters
            ocr(tmp_file.name, output_file.name, language=language, output_type=output_type)
            output_file.close()

            # Send the output file back as a response
            return send_file(output_file.name, as_attachment=True, attachment_filename='output.pdf')
```

In this example, the OCR function is called inside the Flask route with the input file and the given parameters. The resulting output file is then saved to a temporary file and returned as a response using the `send_file` function from Flask. You will need to modify this example to fit your specific use case, including handling any errors that may occur during file uploads or OCR processing.

> How can I test this using curl?

1 / 1

To test the OCR API using `curl`, you can use the following command:

bash

```bash
curl -X POST -F "file=@/path/to/input.pdf" -F "language=eng" -F "output_type=pdfa" http://localhost:5000/ocrmypdf > output.pdf
```

This command sends a `POST` request to the OCR API endpoint at `http://localhost:5000/ocrmypdf`, with the input file specified using the `-F "file=@/path/to/input.pdf"` option. The other parameters (`language` and `output_type`) are also specified as form data using the `-F` option.

The output of the OCR API call is then redirected to a file named `output.pdf` using the `> output.pdf` syntax.

Note that you will need to modify the command to match the specific URL and parameters of your OCR API endpoint.

1 / 1

The `send_file()` function in Flask does not take the `attachment_filename` keyword argument. Instead, you need to pass the `as_attachment=True` argument to force the browser to download the file as an attachment.

To fix the error, replace the line:

kotlin

```kotlin
return send_file(output_file.name, as_attachment=True, attachment_filename='output.pdf')
```

with:

kotlin

```kotlin
return send_file(output_file.name, as_attachment=True, attachment_filename='output.pdf')
```

This should fix the error and allow the Flask app to return the OCR output file as a downloadable attachment.

> 1 / 1

> The \`attachment\_filename\` parameter is incorrect, the correct parameter is \`download\_name\`

1 / 1

You are correct. I apologize for the mistake in my previous response.

To fix the error, replace the line:

kotlin

```kotlin
return send_file(output_file.name, as_attachment=True, attachment_filename='output.pdf')
```

with:

kotlin

```kotlin
return send_file(output_file.name, as_attachment=True, download_name='output.pdf')
```

This should fix the error and allow the Flask app to return the OCR output file as a downloadable attachment with the filename "output.pdf".

> Since \`ocr\` function supports readable stream for input file, can you revise the code to reduce the usage of temple?

1 / 1

Yes, we can modify the Flask app to use a readable stream for the input file, instead of saving the input file to a temporary file. This can help reduce the amount of temporary storage required by the app.

Here's an updated version of the Flask app that uses a readable stream for the input file:

python

```python
from io import BytesIO
from flask import Flask, request, send_file
from ocrmypdf import ocr
from ocrmypdf.exceptions import OcrmypdfExitCodeError

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/ocrmypdf', methods=['POST'])
def ocrmypdf_api():
    input_file = request.files['file'].stream
    output_file = BytesIO()

    try:
        ocr(input_file=input_file, output_file=output_file)
    except OcrmypdfExitCodeError as e:
        return str(e), 400

    output_file.seek(0)
    return send_file(output_file, as_attachment=True, download_name='output.pdf')
```

In this version of the app, we create a `BytesIO` object to hold the output file, instead of using a temporary file. We pass the input file as a readable stream directly to the `ocr()` function, without saving it to a temporary file. After OCR is complete, we set the file pointer of the output file back to the beginning (`output_file.seek(0)`) and then return the output file as a downloadable attachment using `send_file()`.

Note that in order to use a readable stream for the input file, we need to access the `stream` attribute of the `FileStorage` object returned by `request.files['file']`. This attribute returns a readable stream that we can pass directly to the `ocr()` function.

> 1 / 1
> 
> Can we use context manager on BytesIO usage to reduce points of failure?

1 / 1

Yes, you can use a context manager on the `BytesIO` object to ensure that it is properly closed and resources are released after it has been used. Here's an updated version of the `ocrmypdf_api` function that uses a context manager on the `BytesIO` object:

python

```python
from io import BytesIO
from flask import Flask, request, send_file
import ocrmypdf

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/ocrmypdf', methods=['POST'])
def ocrmypdf_api():
    input_file = request.files.get('file')

    if not input_file:
        return {'error': 'No file uploaded'}, 400

    with BytesIO() as input_buffer:
        input_buffer.write(input_file.read())
        input_buffer.seek(0)

        with BytesIO() as output_buffer:
            ocrmypdf.ocr(input_buffer, output_buffer)

            output_buffer.seek(0)
            return send_file(output_buffer, as_attachment=True, download_name='output.pdf')
```

Here, we use a `with` statement to create the `BytesIO` object as a context manager, and the `with` block ensures that the object is properly closed when it is no longer needed.

> Build a simple frontend for this app so users can drag and drop single PDFs to get the OCR version downloaded in browser

1 / 1

Sure! Here's an example of how you can create a simple HTML form that allows users to upload a PDF file, and a bit of JavaScript code to handle the drag-and-drop functionality.

index.html:

html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>OCRmyPDF Web App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="drop-zone" style="border: 2px dashed #bbb; padding: 20px; text-align: center;">
      <p>Drag and drop your PDF file here or click to select file</p>
      <input type="file" id="file-input" style="display: none;">
    </div>
    <script>
      const dropZone = document.getElementById('drop-zone');

      dropZone.addEventListener('dragover', (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        dropZone.style.backgroundColor = '#ccc';
      });

      dropZone.addEventListener('dragleave', () => {
        dropZone.style.backgroundColor = '';
      });

      dropZone.addEventListener('drop', (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        dropZone.style.backgroundColor = '';

        const fileInput = document.getElementById('file-input');
        fileInput.files = event.dataTransfer.files;

        submitForm();
      });

      function submitForm() {
        const form = new FormData();
        form.append('file', document.getElementById('file-input').files[0]);

        fetch('/api/ocrmypdf', {
          method: 'POST',
          body: form,
        })
        .then(response => response.blob())
        .then(blob => {
          const url = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob);
          const link = document.createElement('a');
          link.href = url;
          link.download = 'output.pdf';
          link.click();
        });
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

This HTML file includes a drop-zone div that listens for drag and drop events, and an input element for file selection. When a file is dropped or selected, it calls the `submitForm()` function, which sends a POST request to the OCRmyPDF API with the selected file as a `FormData` object.

The API responds with the OCR'd PDF file as a blob, which is then converted to a URL and downloaded in the browser using a dynamically created link element.

> 
> Incorporate this back to the Flask app to serve this page

1 / 1

To serve the frontend page in the Flask app, you can modify the `ocrmypdf_api` function to render the HTML page instead of directly processing the OCR request. Here's an example implementation:

python

```python
from flask import Flask, request, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/api/ocrmypdf', methods=['POST'])
def ocrmypdf_api():
    input_file = request.files.get('file')
    output_file = io.BytesIO()

    # Run OCR
    try:
        ocrmypdf.ocr(input_file=input_file, output_file=output_file)
    except Exception as e:
        return str(e), 500

    # Return output file as download
    output_file.seek(0)
    return send_file(output_file, as_attachment=True, download_name='output.pdf')
```

In this implementation, the `index` function simply returns the rendered HTML template for the frontend page. The `ocrmypdf_api` function reads the uploaded file from the request using `request.files.get('file')` and passes it to the `ocr` function. The output file is then returned as a download using the `send_file` function.

Note that the form in the frontend page should have `enctype="multipart/form-data"` set and the file input should have `name="file"`.

> 1 / 1
> 
> Let’s try to use context manager on \`output\_file\`

1 / 1

Sure, we can use a context manager for the `output_file` as well. Here's an updated version of the `ocrmypdf_api` function that uses a context manager for the `output_file`:

python

```python
@app.route('/ocrmypdf', methods=['POST'])
def ocrmypdf_api():
    input_file = request.files['file']
    if not input_file:
        return "No file uploaded", 400

    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:
        input_path = os.path.join(temp_dir, input_file.filename)
        input_file.save(input_path)

        with BytesIO() as output_buffer:
            try:
                ocrmypdf.ocr(input_path, output_buffer)
            except Exception as e:
                return str(e), 500

            output_buffer.seek(0)
            output_filename = f"{os.path.splitext(input_file.filename)[0]}_ocr.pdf"

            return send_file(
                output_buffer,
                as_attachment=True,
                download_name=output_filename
            )
```

Here, we use a `with` statement to create a context manager for the `output_buffer` as before, and then we also use another `with` statement to create a context manager for the `output_file`. This ensures that the `output_file` is properly closed and cleaned up after the `with` block is executed, even if an exception occurs.

> 1 / 1
> 
> Modify it so no tempfile usage, and incorporate the HTML serving as well as the new \`/api/ocrmypdf\` route

1 / 1

Here's a modified version of the Flask app that uses a context manager for the output file and incorporates both the HTML serving and the new `/api/ocrmypdf` route. It also removes the use of tempfile for the input file and uses the `BytesIO` object instead:

python

```python
import os
import subprocess
from io import BytesIO
from pathlib import Path

from flask import Flask, render_template, request, send_file
from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename

app = Flask(__name__)

UPLOAD_FOLDER = 'uploads'
app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'] = UPLOAD_FOLDER

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/api/ocrmypdf', methods=['POST'])
def ocrmypdf_api():
    # check if the post request has the file part
    if 'file' not in request.files:
        return 'No file part'

    file = request.files['file']
    # if user does not select file, browser also
    # submit an empty part without filename
    if file.filename == '':
        return 'No selected file'

    if file:
        filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
        input_data = BytesIO(file.read())
        input_data.name = filename

        output_data = BytesIO()
        output_data.name = filename

        try:
            subprocess.run(
                ['ocrmypdf', input_data, output_data],
                check=True,
                stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
                stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
            )
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
            return f'Error: {e.stderr}'

        output_data.seek(0)

        return send_file(output_data, as_attachment=True, download_name=filename)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This implementation reads the input file data into a `BytesIO` object named `input_data` and the output file data into a `BytesIO` object named `output_data`. The `with` statement is used to ensure that the `output_data` file is properly closed and cleaned up after the OCR operation completes.

The `send_file` function is used to send the output file data back to the client as a file attachment. The `as_attachment=True` parameter forces the client to download the file rather than display it in the browser, and the `download_name` parameter is used to specify the filename of the downloaded file.

The HTML form in the `index.html` template is used to allow users to select a file to upload. When the form is submitted, the file data is sent to the `/api/ocrmypdf` route via a POST request. The server reads the file data from the request and performs OCR on it using the `ocrmypdf` command line tool. The resulting output file is then sent back to the client as a file attachment.

> Revise the Flask API to not use \`tempfile\` and just take advantage of the IO streams for uploaded file as input, and bytes io as output for ocrmypdf.ocr

1 / 1

Sure, here's a revised version of the Flask API that doesn't use `tempfile` and uses IO streams for input and output:

python

```python
from flask import Flask, request, send_file, render_template
from io import BytesIO
import ocrmypdf

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/api/ocrmypdf', methods=['POST'])
def ocrmypdf_api():
    file = request.files['file']

    input_stream = BytesIO(file.read())
    output_stream = BytesIO()

    ocrmypdf.ocr(input_stream, output_stream)

    output_stream.seek(0)
    return send_file(output_stream, as_attachment=True, attachment_filename='output.pdf')
```

In this version, we use `BytesIO` to create input and output streams for the `ocr()` function instead of creating a temporary file. We read the uploaded file into the input stream and pass it directly to the `ocr()` function. Similarly, we use a `BytesIO` object for the output stream and return its contents directly using `send_file()`.

> 1 / 1
> 
> Would it be better to use context manager on the BytesIO?

1 / 1

Yes, it's generally a good idea to use a context manager for `BytesIO` objects to ensure proper resource management and avoid potential memory leaks. Here's an example of how you could use a context manager for the `BytesIO` object:

python

```python
from io import BytesIO

# Create BytesIO object
output_file = BytesIO()

with output_file:
    ocrmypdf.ocr(input_file, output_file=output_file)
    output_file.seek(0)  # Reset file pointer to beginning
    pdf_bytes = output_file.read()

# Do something with pdf_bytes
```

This ensures that the `BytesIO` object is properly closed and all resources are freed once the code block within the `with` statement is finished executing.

> 1 / 1
> 
> Incorporate the context manager usage back to the Flask API

1 / 1

Sure, here's an example of how to incorporate a context manager for the `BytesIO` object in the Flask API:

python

```python
from flask import Flask, request, send_file
from io import BytesIO
import ocrmypdf

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return """

            </form>
        </body>
    </html>
    """

@app.route("/api/ocrmypdf", methods=["POST"])
def ocrmypdf_api():
    # Get the input file from the form data
    input_file = request.files.get("file")

    # Run OCRmyPDF on the input file and write the output to a BytesIO object
    with BytesIO() as output_buffer:
        ocrmypdf.ocr(input_file, output_buffer)

        # Set the BytesIO object's current position to the beginning of the buffer
        output_buffer.seek(0)

        # Send the BytesIO object as a file attachment
        return send_file(output_buffer, as_attachment=True, attachment_filename='output.pdf')
```

This ensures that the `BytesIO` object is properly closed and cleaned up when it goes out of scope, even if an error occurs during the OCR process.

> 1 / 1
> 
> \`send\_file\` doesn’t have \`attachment\_filename\` but \`download\_name\`

1 / 1

You are correct, my apologies for the mistake. The correct parameter to use with `send_file` is `as_attachment=True` to force the browser to download the file, and `download_name='output.pdf'` to specify the filename of the downloaded file. Here is an updated version of the `ocrmypdf_api` function that uses these parameters:

python

```python
@app.route('/api/ocrmypdf', methods=['POST'])
def ocrmypdf_api():
    # Get the uploaded file from the request
    file = request.files['file']

    # Use BytesIO to avoid using a temporary file
    with BytesIO() as input_buffer, BytesIO() as output_buffer:
        # Read the uploaded file into the input buffer
        input_buffer.write(file.read())
        input_buffer.seek(0)

        # Run OCRmyPDF on the input buffer and write the output to the output buffer
        ocrmypdf.ocr(input_buffer, output_buffer)

        # Return the output buffer as a downloadable file
        output_buffer.seek(0)
        return send_file(output_buffer, as_attachment=True, download_name='output.pdf')
```

This version of the function uses context managers with `BytesIO` to avoid using a temporary file, and it uses the correct parameters for `send_file` to specify the filename of the downloaded file.

> 1 / 1
> 
> Is \`input\_buffer\` necessary?

1 / 1

Yes, `input_buffer` is necessary because it is the input file that is being uploaded by the user. It is used as the input for the `ocr` function which performs OCR on the input file and returns the output as a bytes object. Without `input_buffer`, there would be no file to OCR.

> 1 / 1
> 
> Would I be able to feed \`file.read()\` directly as the input for the \`ocr\` function?

1 / 1

Yes, you can pass the result of `file.read()` directly as the input to the `ocr` function.

When you call `file.read()` it returns the contents of the file as bytes, which is the expected format for the `ocr` function's input. You can pass this result directly to the `ocr` function as the `input_file_stream` argument.

Here's an example of how you can modify the Flask API to accept file uploads and pass the uploaded file directly to the `ocr` function:

python

```python
from io import BytesIO
from flask import Flask, request, send_file

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])
def index():
    return '''

```

In this example, the `request.files['file']` object is a `FileStorage` object that represents the uploaded file. By calling `input_file.stream.read()`, we obtain the contents of the file as bytes, which we can pass directly to the `ocr` function.

1 / 1

The error suggests that `arg_string` is not a string type, but an int. It's possible that `cmdline` argument passed to `create_options` function is not a list of strings, but a list of integers.

To fix this, make sure that the `cmdline` argument is a list of strings before passing it to the `create_options` function. You can convert it to a list of strings using a list comprehension, like this:

scss

```scss
cmdline = [str(arg) for arg in cmdline]
options = create_options(**create_options_kwargs)
```

This will ensure that all elements of the `cmdline` list are strings, which is expected by the `argparse` module.

> Given \`ocr\` function’s first two parameters have the following descriptions: breakpoints. input\_file – If a pathlib.Path, str or bytes, this is interpreted as file system path to the input file. If the object appears to be a readable stream (with methods such as .read() and .seek()), the object will be read in its entirety and saved to a temporary file. If input\_file is "-", standard input will be read. output\_file – If a pathlib.Path, str or bytes, this is interpreted as file system path to the output file. If the object appears to be a writable stream (with methods such as .write() and .seek()), the output will be written to this stream. If output\_file is "-", the output will be written to sys.stdout (provided that standard output does not seem to be a terminal device). When a stream is used as output, whether via a writable object or "-", some final validation steps are not performed (we do not read back the stream after it is written). And \`request.files\['file'\]\` is a \`FileStorage\` which has the following description: The FileStorage class is a thin wrapper over incoming files. It is used by the request object to represent uploaded files. All the attributes of the wrapper stream are proxied by the file storage so it’s possible to do storage.read() instead of the long form storage.stream.read(). How can I simplify the API?

1 / 1

You can simplify the API by making use of the `FileStorage` object directly instead of creating an `io.BytesIO` object from it. Here's an updated version of the `ocrmypdf_api` function that uses `FileStorage`:

python

```python
from flask import Flask, request, send_file
from ocrmypdf import ocr

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])
def index():
    return 'Hello, World!'

@app.route('/ocrmypdf', methods=['POST'])
def ocrmypdf_api():
    # Get the uploaded file
    input_file = request.files['file']

    # Call the OCR function
    output_file = ocr(input_file.stream, '-')

    # Return the output file as a download
    return send_file(output_file, as_attachment=True, download_name='output.pdf')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This code directly passes the `input_file.stream` to the `ocr` function, and uses `'-'` as the output file name to indicate that the output should be written to stdout. The resulting output is returned directly to the client using `send_file`.

1 / 1

The `ocr` function expects file paths as input arguments, but in these cases, we're passing in `FileStorage` or `SpooledTemporaryFile` objects. To fix this, we can pass the path to a temporary file created by Flask's `FileStorage` object to the `ocr` function. Here's an updated implementation of the `ocrmypdf_api` function that should work:

python

```python
@app.route('/ocrmypdf', methods=['POST'])
def ocrmypdf_api():
    input_file = request.files['file']
    output_file = request.form['output_file']

    # Create a temporary file and write the contents of input_file to it
    temp_input_file = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False)
    input_file.save(temp_input_file.name)

    # Run OCR on the temporary file and save the output to a temporary file
    temp_output_file = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False)
    ocr(temp_input_file.name, temp_output_file.name)

    # Copy the contents of the output file to the response stream
    temp_output_file.seek(0)
    response = send_file(temp_output_file, as_attachment=True, attachment_filename=output_file)

    # Delete the temporary input and output files
    os.unlink(temp_input_file.name)
    os.unlink(temp_output_file.name)

    return response
```

Here, we create a temporary file using Python's built-in `tempfile` module, write the contents of the `FileStorage` object to it, and pass its path to the `ocr` function. After the OCR process is complete, we open the output file as a temporary file, copy its contents to the response stream, and delete both temporary files.

Note that we're using the `send_file` function from Flask to send the contents of the output file in the response, rather than opening the file and writing its contents to the response stream manually. This is a more efficient and idiomatic way of serving files in Flask.

Regarding the error message "TypeError: 'in <string>' requires string as left operand, not int", it occurs when we try to pass a byte string (`bytes`) to a function that expects a string. To fix this, we can decode the byte string to a string before passing it to the function. Here's an updated implementation of the `ocrmypdf_api` function that uses `input_file.stream.read().decode()` to decode the byte string:

python

```python
@app.route('/ocrmypdf', methods=['POST'])
def ocrmypdf_api():
    input_file = request.files['file']
    output_file = request.form['output_file']

    # Run OCR on the file stream and save the output to a temporary file
    temp_output_file = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False)
    ocr(input_file.stream.read().decode(), temp_output_file.name)

    # Copy the contents of the output file to the response stream
    temp_output_file.seek(0)
    response = send_file(temp_output_file, as_attachment=True, attachment_filename=output_file)

    # Delete the temporary output file
    os.unlink(temp_output_file.name)

    return response
```

Here, we're calling `decode()` on the byte string returned by `input_file.stream.read()` to convert it to a string before passing it to the `ocr` function.

> 1 / 1
> 
> replace the use of tempfile with BytesIO

1 / 1

To replace the use of `tempfile` with `BytesIO`, you can modify the `ocr` function as follows:

python

```python
from io import BytesIO

def ocr(breakpoints, input_file, output_file):
    # If input_file is a stream, read its contents into a BytesIO buffer
    if hasattr(input_file, "read") and callable(input_file.read):
        input_file = BytesIO(input_file.read())
    
    # If output_file is stdout, write to a BytesIO buffer
    if output_file == "-":
        output_file = BytesIO()

    # Call ocrmypdf with breakpoints, input_file, and output_file as arguments
    ocrmypdf.ocr(input_file, output_file, *breakpoints)

    # If output_file is a BytesIO buffer, return its contents as bytes
    if isinstance(output_file, BytesIO):
        return output_file.getvalue()

    # Otherwise, return the output_file path
    return output_file
```

Here, we use `BytesIO` to create an in-memory buffer to read the contents of the input file stream, and we check if the output file is `-`, in which case we write to another `BytesIO` buffer. Finally, if the output file is a `BytesIO` buffer, we return its contents as bytes, otherwise, we return the output file path.

> 1 / 1
> 
> No, replace in the context of its usage, not the definition of \`ocr\` function itself

1 / 1

Here's an example of how you could replace the usage of `tempfile` with `BytesIO`:

python

```python
from io import BytesIO

with BytesIO() as output_buffer:
    with open(input_file, 'rb') as input_file:
        input_buffer = BytesIO(input_file.read())
    ocr(input_buffer, output_buffer)
    output_file.write(output_buffer.getvalue())
```

In this example, we use `BytesIO` to create an in-memory buffer for the input file, which we then pass to the `ocr` function. Similarly, we create an in-memory buffer for the output file using `BytesIO` and write its contents to the actual output file using `output_buffer.getvalue()`.

Where I have: @app.route('/ocrmypdf', methods=\['POST'\]) def ocrmypdf\_api(): input\_file = request.files\['file'\] # Perform OCR on the input file with BytesIO() as output\_buffer, BytesIO(input\_file.read()) as input\_buffer: ocr(input\_buffer, output\_buffer) output\_buffer.seek(0) return send\_file(output\_buffer, as\_attachment=True, download\_name='output.pdf')

1 / 1

The error occurs because the `input_file` is being read into a BytesIO object that is closed once the `with` block ends, but the `ocr` function is called within the block.

To fix the error, you should read the `input_file` into a separate variable outside the `with` block and pass that variable to the `ocr` function. Here's an updated version of the code:

python

```python
@app.route('/ocrmypdf', methods=['POST'])
def ocrmypdf_api():
    input_file = request.files['file']

    # Read input file into memory
    input_data = input_file.read()

    # Perform OCR on the input data
    with BytesIO() as output_buffer, BytesIO(input_data) as input_buffer:
        ocr(input_buffer, output_buffer)

        # Seek to the beginning of the output buffer before sending it
        output_buffer.seek(0)
        return send_file(output_buffer, as_attachment=True, download_name='output.pdf')
```

Here, `input_data` is used as the input to the `ocr` function, and the `output_buffer` is still used to store the output. After `ocr` completes, the `output_buffer` is seeked to the beginning before sending it as a file attachment.

> 1 / 1
> 
> I believe the error is complaining about \`output\_buffer\` being closed

1 / 1

Yes, that could be the case. One way to fix this is to remove the `with` block for `output_buffer` and manually close the `input_buffer` at the end of the function. Here's an updated version of the code:

python

```python
@app.route('/ocrmypdf', methods=['POST'])
def ocrmypdf_api():
    input_file = request.files['file']

    # Perform OCR on the input file
    output_buffer = BytesIO()
    with BytesIO(input_file.read()) as input_buffer:
        ocr(input_buffer, output_buffer)
        output_buffer.seek(0)
        return send_file(output_buffer, as_attachment=True, download_name='output.pdf')
    input_buffer.close()
```

By removing the `with` block for `output_buffer`, we avoid closing the buffer prematurely. And by explicitly closing `input_buffer` at the end of the function, we make sure that it gets closed properly.

> 1 / 1
> 
> \`input\_buffer.close() would not be reached after the \`return send\_file\` line right?

1 / 1

You are correct. The `input_buffer.close()` would not be reached after the `return send_file` line because the function will have already returned and exited the `with` block.

However, you don't need to explicitly close the `BytesIO` objects as they are context managers and will automatically close when the `with` block ends. Therefore, you can remove both `input_buffer.close()` and `output_buffer.close()` lines from your code.

Here's the updated code:

python

```python
@app.route('/ocrmypdf', methods=['POST'])
def ocrmypdf_api():
    input_file = request.files['file']

    # Perform OCR on the input file
    with BytesIO() as output_buffer, BytesIO(input_file.read()) as input_buffer:
        ocr(input_buffer, output_buffer)
        output_buffer.seek(0)
        return send_file(output_buffer, as_attachment=True, download_name='output.pdf')
```

> 1 / 1
> 
> I believe the issue is that \`output\_buffer\` isn’t initiated as writeable stream

1 / 1

You are correct. The `BytesIO()` constructor returns a BytesIO object that is writeable, but in the provided code it is opened in read-only mode. To fix the issue, you can simply remove the `input_buffer` context manager and initialize `output_buffer` as writeable:

python

```python
@app.route('/ocrmypdf', methods=['POST'])
def ocrmypdf_api():
    input_file = request.files['file']

    # Perform OCR on the input file
    with BytesIO() as output_buffer:
        ocr(input_file, output_buffer)
        output_buffer.seek(0)
        return send_file(output_buffer, as_attachment=True, download_name='output.pdf')
```

This code will use `BytesIO()` to create a writeable buffer object `output_buffer`, and pass it to the `ocr()` function as the second argument. The `input_file` object from the `request.files` dictionary will be passed as the first argument. Finally, the `output_buffer` is seeked to the beginning of the file and returned as a response with the `send_file()` function.

1 / 1

Here's a revised version that sets the download name based on the uploaded filename, a timestamp, and a reasonable indicator of it being OCR'ed:

python

```python
from datetime import datetime
import re

@app.route('/ocrmypdf', methods=['POST'])
def ocrmypdf_api():
    input_file = request.files['file']

    # Determine the download name based on the uploaded filename, a timestamp,
    # and a reasonable indicator of it being OCR'ed
    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S')
    filename = re.sub(r'\.(pdf|PDF)$', '', input_file.filename)
    download_name = f'{filename}_ocr_{timestamp}.pdf'

    with NamedTemporaryFile(suffix='.pdf') as output_file, BytesIO(input_file.read()) as input_buffer:
        ocr(input_buffer, output_file.name)
        return send_file(output_file.name, as_attachment=True, download_name=download_name)
```

This version uses the `datetime` module to generate a timestamp in the format `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS`, and uses the `re` module to remove the file extension (if any) from the uploaded filename. It then constructs the download name by combining the filename, the OCR indicator, and the timestamp, separated by underscores. The resulting `download_name` is then passed to the `send_file` function.

> 1 / 1
> 
> Add safeguard to check the uploaded file is of type PDF

1 / 1

You can add a check to ensure that the uploaded file is of type PDF before passing it to the OCR function. Here's an example:

python

```python
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {'pdf'}

def allowed_file(filename):
    return '.' in filename and filename.rsplit('.', 1)[1].lower() in ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS

@app.route('/ocrmypdf', methods=['POST'])
def ocrmypdf_api():
    input_file = request.files['file']
    if not allowed_file(input_file.filename):
        return "Error: File must be in PDF format", 400

    with NamedTemporaryFile(suffix='.pdf') as output_file, BytesIO(input_file.read()) as input_buffer:
        ocr(input_buffer, output_file.name)
        output_filename = f"{os.path.splitext(input_file.filename)[0]}_ocr_{datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S')}.pdf"
        return send_file(output_file.name, as_attachment=True, download_name=output_filename)
```

This code adds a function `allowed_file` to check that the uploaded file is of type PDF, and returns a 400 error if it is not. It also modifies the `download_name` parameter to include the original filename, a timestamp, and an indicator that the file has been OCR'ed.

> 1 / 1
> 
> Add another safeguard for not having exactly one uploaded file, and the file must be of type PDF

1 / 1

Sure, you can add the following code snippet to check that:

python

```python
@app.route('/ocrmypdf', methods=['POST'])
def ocrmypdf_api():
    if 'file' not in request.files:
        return 'No file uploaded', 400
    
    uploaded_file = request.files['file']
    
    if uploaded_file.filename == '':
        return 'No file selected', 400
    
    if uploaded_file.mimetype != 'application/pdf':
        return 'Invalid file type, please upload a PDF file', 400
    
    # Read the PDF file and perform OCR on it
    with NamedTemporaryFile(suffix='.pdf') as output_file, BytesIO(uploaded_file.read()) as input_buffer:
        ocr(input_buffer, output_file.name)
        
        # Set the name of the resulting OCR'ed file
        timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d-%H%M%S")
        filename_parts = os.path.splitext(uploaded_file.filename)
        output_filename = f"{filename_parts[0]}_{timestamp}_OCR{filename_parts[1]}"
        
        # Send the resulting file back to the user
        return send_file(output_file.name, as_attachment=True, download_name=output_filename)
```

This code checks that the uploaded file is of type PDF and has a filename. It also generates a unique filename for the resulting OCR'ed file based on the uploaded file's name, a timestamp, and an indicator that it has been OCR'ed.

To restrict the upload type to PDF only, you can add the `accept` attribute to the file input element and set its value to `"application/pdf"`. Here's the updated HTML template:

python

```python
@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])
def index():
    return '''

                </form>
            </body>
        </html>

```

This will restrict the file selection dialog to only show PDF files.

Here's an updated version of the API that handles the `ocrmypdf.exceptions.PriorOcrFoundError` exception in the `ocr` function:

python

```python

def ocrmypdf_api():
    # Check if exactly one file was uploaded and that it is a PDF
    if 'file' not in request.files:
        return 'No file uploaded'
    file = request.files['file']
    if file.filename == '':
        return 'No file selected'
    if file.mimetype != 'application/pdf':
        return 'File must be of type PDF'
    
    # Generate output file name
    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S')
    output_filename = f'{file.filename}_OCR_{timestamp}.pdf'
    
    # Perform OCR on the input file
    with NamedTemporaryFile(suffix='.pdf') as output_file, BytesIO(file.read()) as input_buffer:
        try:
            ocrmypdf.ocr(input_buffer, output_file.name)
        except ocrmypdf.exceptions.PriorOcrFoundError:
            return 'The PDF already contains text.'
        output_file.seek(0)
        return send_file(output_file, as_attachment=True, download_name=output_filename)
```

In the updated version of the API, the `ocr` function is called within a try-except block that catches the `ocrmypdf.exceptions.PriorOcrFoundError` exception. If this exception is raised, the API returns a message indicating that the PDF already contains text.

Note that if the `ocr` function raises a different exception, such as a `FileNotFoundError` or a `CommandNotFoundError`, the exception will not be caught by the try-except block in the API and will be raised as usual. It may be worth adding additional error handling to the API to catch these exceptions as well.

To add options for `force_ocr`, `skip_text`, and `redo_ocr` to the HTML form, we can add checkboxes for each option with appropriate names, such as `force_ocr`, `skip_text`, and `redo_ocr`. Here's an updated HTML form with these checkboxes:

html

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <body>
        <form action='/ocrmypdf' method='post' enctype='multipart/form-data'>
            <input type='file' name='file' accept='application/pdf'>
            <br>
            <label for='force_ocr'>Force OCR:</label>
            <input type='checkbox' name='force_ocr' id='force_ocr' value='1'>
            <br>
            <label for='skip_text'>Skip Text:</label>
            <input type='checkbox' name='skip_text' id='skip_text' value='1'>
            <br>
            <label for='redo_ocr'>Redo OCR:</label>
            <input type='checkbox' name='redo_ocr' id='redo_ocr' value='1'>
            <br>
            <input type='submit' value='OCR PDF'>
        </form>
    </body>
</html>
```

We can then modify the `ocrmypdf_api` function to read these options from the form data and pass them to the `ocr` function:

python

```python
@app.route('/ocrmypdf', methods=['POST'])
def ocrmypdf_api():
    input_file = request.files['file']
    force_ocr = bool(request.form.get('force_ocr'))
    skip_text = bool(request.form.get('skip_text'))
    redo_ocr = bool(request.form.get('redo_ocr'))

    if not input_file or input_file.content_type != 'application/pdf':
        abort(400, 'Please upload a single PDF file.')

    with NamedTemporaryFile(suffix='.pdf') as output_file, BytesIO(input_file.read()) as input_buffer:
        ocr(input_buffer, output_file.name, force_ocr=force_ocr, skip_text=skip_text, redo_ocr=redo_ocr)

        output_buffer = BytesIO()
        with open(output_file.name, 'rb') as f:
            output_buffer.write(f.read())
        output_buffer.seek(0)

        timestamp = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S')
        filename = secure_filename(f'{input_file.filename}_{timestamp}_OCR.pdf')
        return send_file(output_buffer, as_attachment=True, download_name=filename)
```

Here, we use the `request.form.get` method to get the values of the `force_ocr`, `skip_text`, and `redo_ocr` checkboxes, which will be `'1'` if they are checked and `None` if they are not. We then convert these values to booleans using the `bool` function.

We also add a check to make sure that the uploaded file is a single PDF file, and we modify the download name to include the original filename, timestamp, and an indication that the file has been OCR'd.

> Replace checkboxes with radio buttons as single choice

1 / 1

To replace the checkboxes with radio buttons as single choice, you can replace the `<input type='checkbox'>` HTML element with the `<input type='radio'>` HTML element.

Here's an updated version of the HTML form with radio buttons:

html

```html
<form action='/ocrmypdf' method='post' enctype='multipart/form-data'>
  <input type='file' name='file' accept='.pdf' required>
  <p>Select OCR options:</p>
  <input type='radio' name='ocr_options' value='force_ocr'>Force OCR<br>
  <input type='radio' name='ocr_options' value='skip_text'>Skip Text<br>
  <input type='radio' name='ocr_options' value='redo_ocr'>Redo OCR<br>
  <br>
  <input type='submit' value='OCR PDF'>
</form>
```

In the backend, you can retrieve the selected radio button value from the `request.form` dictionary:

python

```python
@app.route('/ocrmypdf', methods=['POST'])
def ocrmypdf_api():
    input_file = request.files['file']
    
    # Get OCR options
    ocr_options = request.form.get('ocr_options')

    # Perform OCR on the input file
    with NamedTemporaryFile(suffix='.pdf') as output_file, BytesIO(input_file.read()) as input_buffer:
        ocr(input_buffer, output_file.name, force_ocr=(ocr_options == 'force_ocr'), skip_text=(ocr_options == 'skip_text'), redo_ocr=(ocr_options == 'redo_ocr'))
        filename = secure_filename(input_file.filename)
        timestamp = datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S')
        download_name = f'{filename}_OCR_{timestamp}.pdf'
        return send_file(output_file.name, as_attachment=True, download_name=download_name)
```

Initial implementation of OCRmyPDF HTTP API

This commit adds an initial implementation of an HTTP API for OCRmyPDF, a tool for OCR'ing PDF files. The API allows users to upload a PDF file and choose OCR options, and then returns an OCR'ed PDF file with a name based on the uploaded file's name, a timestamp, and an indicator that it has been OCR'ed.

The API includes safeguards to ensure that only PDF files are uploaded, and that the uploaded file is valid and contains no existing OCR. If an error occurs during the OCR process, the API returns an appropriate error message to the user.

One way to make the subject line shorter while retaining its meaning could be:

feat: add index route for PDF OCR

This reduces the length by 5 characters while still clearly indicating that an index route has been added to perform OCR on PDF files.

> \`OCRmyPDF\` can be tricky to setup on different platforms, therefore I want to containerize the whole environment and the API/web frontend using Docker and docker-compose. Can you do that?

1 / 1

Yes, I can help you with that. Here's a basic outline of the steps involved in containerizing OCRmyPDF with Docker and docker-compose:

1.  Create a Dockerfile for the OCRmyPDF environment
2.  Create a docker-compose.yml file to orchestrate the OCRmyPDF containers
3.  Build the Docker image for the OCRmyPDF environment
4.  Launch the OCRmyPDF environment using docker-compose

Here are some more detailed instructions on how to do each step:

1.  Create a Dockerfile for the OCRmyPDF environment

Create a new file called `Dockerfile` in the root directory of your project and add the following content:

Dockerfile

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    poppler-utils \
    tesseract-ocr \
    libtesseract-dev \
    libleptonica-dev \
    libffi-dev \
    libcairo2-dev \
    libpango1.0-dev \
    libmagic-dev \
    liblcms2-dev \
    libwebp-dev \
    libopenjp2-7-dev \
    libxml2-dev \
    libxslt1-dev \
    zlib1g-dev \
    gcc \
    make \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir ocrmypdf

WORKDIR /app

COPY . .

EXPOSE 5000

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

This Dockerfile uses the official Python 3.9 image as its base, installs the necessary system dependencies for OCRmyPDF, and installs OCRmyPDF itself using pip. It also sets the working directory to `/app`, copies the contents of the current directory to the Docker image, exposes port 5000 for the web frontend, and starts the Flask app by running `app.py`.

2.  Create a docker-compose.yml file to orchestrate the OCRmyPDF containers

Create a new file called `docker-compose.yml` in the root directory of your project and add the following content:

yml

```yml
version: "3.9"

services:
  ocrmypdf:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    environment:
      - FLASK_ENV=production
```

This docker-compose.yml file defines a single service named `ocrmypdf`, which is built from the current directory using the Dockerfile we created earlier. It maps port 5000 from the container to port 5000 on the host machine, mounts the current directory to `/app` in the container, and sets the `FLASK_ENV` environment variable to `production`.

3.  Build the Docker image for the OCRmyPDF environment

To build the Docker image, run the following command in the root directory of your project:

sh

```sh
docker build -t ocrmypdf .
```

This command will build the Docker image using the `Dockerfile` in the current directory, and tag it with the name `ocrmypdf`.

4.  Launch the OCRmyPDF environment using docker-compose

To launch the OCRmyPDF environment using docker-compose, run the following command in the root directory of your project:

sh

```sh
docker-compose up
```

This command will start the `ocrmypdf` service defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file. You should see the Flask app start up, and you should be able to access the OCRmyPDF web frontend by navigating to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.

That's it! You've successfully containerized the OCRmyPDF environment using Docker and docker-compose.

> 1 / 1
> 
> Revise the above containerization with the following facts: - There is an official image \`jbarlow83/ocrmypdf\` - I would like to incorporate the following Pipfile for production dependencies and the designated Python version \`\`\`Pipfile \[\[source\]\] url = "https://pypi.org/simple" verify\_ssl = true name = "pypi" \[packages\] ocrmypdf = "\*" flask = "\*" \[dev-packages\] black = "\*" \[requires\] python\_version = "3.10" \`\`\`

1 / 1

Sure, here's a revised `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` that incorporates the official `jbarlow83/ocrmypdf` image and the Pipfile for production dependencies:

**Dockerfile:**

dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM jbarlow83/ocrmypdf

COPY Pipfile Pipfile.lock /app/
RUN pip install pipenv && pipenv install --system --deploy

COPY . /app
```

**docker-compose.yml:**

yaml

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
```

This `Dockerfile` starts with the official `jbarlow83/ocrmypdf` image as the base image, copies the Pipfile and Pipfile.lock files to `/app/`, and installs `pipenv`. It then installs the packages listed in the Pipfile using `pipenv install --system --deploy`. Finally, it copies the rest of the application code to `/app/`.

The `docker-compose.yml` file specifies that the `app` service should be built from the current directory (which contains the `Dockerfile`), and maps port 5000 on the container to port 5000 on the host.

> 1 / 1
> 
> The docker-compose file lacks a running command to launch the Flask server

1 / 1

You're right, apologies for the oversight. Here's the revised docker-compose.yml file:

yaml

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  ocrmypdf-api:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
      - ./app:/app
    environment:
      - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
    command: gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 wsgi:app
    depends_on:
      - ocrmypdf

  ocrmypdf:
    image: jbarlow83/ocrmypdf
    command: tail -f /dev/null
```

The `command` field in the `ocrmypdf-api` service is updated to run the Flask app using Gunicorn. It specifies to start the server with 4 worker processes, bind to port 5000, and use the `wsgi.py` file as the application entry point.

Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns!

> 1 / 1
> 
> How would the Dockerfile look like for the \`ocrmypdf-api\` service?

1 / 1

The `Dockerfile` for the `ocrmypdf-api` service would look something like this:

Dockerfile

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim-buster

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the Pipfile and Pipfile.lock to the container
COPY Pipfile Pipfile.lock ./

# Install production dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir pipenv && pipenv install --system --deploy

# Copy the source code to the container
COPY . .

# Expose the port for the Flask server
EXPOSE 5000

# Launch the Flask server
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

This `Dockerfile` uses the official Python 3.10 image as its base, sets the working directory to `/app`, and copies the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` to the container. It then installs `pipenv` and installs the production dependencies using `pipenv`. Finally, it copies the source code to the container, exposes port `5000` for the Flask server, and launches the Flask server using the `CMD` instruction.

> 1 / 1
> 
> How would I update Pipfile to include gunicorn dependency?

1 / 1

To include `gunicorn` dependency in your `Pipfile`, you can simply add it to the `[packages]` section as follows:

makefile

```makefile
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"

[packages]
ocrmypdf = "*"
flask = "*"
gunicorn = "*"

[dev-packages]
black = "*"

[requires]
python_version = "3.10"
```

Make sure to run `pipenv install` command after updating the `Pipfile` to install the new dependencies.

> 1 / 1
> 
> How would update docker-compose to use flask command line interface to run the app without gunicorn?

1 / 1

To use the Flask CLI instead of Gunicorn in the `docker-compose.yml` file, you can replace the `command` section of the `ocrmypdf-api` service with the following:

less

```less
command: flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000
```

This command uses the `flask run` command to start the server, with the `--host` and `--port` options specifying that the server should listen on all network interfaces on port 5000. Note that this command assumes that the Flask application is named `app` and that it can be found in a file named `app.py`. If your application has a different name or is located in a different file, you will need to adjust the command accordingly.

1 / 1

Here are some suggestions to improve the Dockerfile:

1.  Use a multi-stage build to reduce image size:
    
    A multi-stage build involves separating the build process into multiple stages, each with its own base image. This can help reduce the size of the final image by removing build dependencies and unnecessary files.
    
2.  Use a smaller base image:
    
    Instead of using `python:3.10-slim-bullseye`, you can use a smaller base image like `python:3.10-alpine`.
    
3.  Combine `apt-get update` and `apt-get install` commands:
    
    By combining the `apt-get update` and `apt-get install` commands into a single command, you can reduce the number of layers in the Docker image and thus reduce the size of the image.
    
4.  Remove unnecessary dependencies:
    
    You can remove `python3-pip` from the list of packages to be installed since Pipenv will already be installed.
    

Here's an updated Dockerfile that incorporates these changes:

perl

```perl
# Use a smaller base image
FROM python:3.10-alpine AS build

# Install OCRmyPDF sys dependencies
RUN apk add --no-cache \
        ghostscript \
        icc-profiles-free \
        libxml2 \
        pngquant \
        tesseract-ocr \
        zlib-dev

# Copy the Pipfile and Pipfile.lock to the container
COPY Pipfile Pipfile.lock ./

# Install dependencies (OCRmyPDF and the web frontend ones)
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir pipenv && pipenv install --system --deploy --ignore-pipfile

# Copy the source code to the container
COPY app.py ./

# Use a smaller base image
FROM python:3.10-alpine

# Copy the installed packages from the previous stage
COPY --from=build /usr/local /usr/local

# Copy the source code to the container
COPY app.py ./

# Expose the port for the Flask server
EXPOSE 8000

# Launch the Flask server
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

In this updated Dockerfile, we have used a multi-stage build to separate the build process into two stages, with the first stage installing the dependencies and the second stage using a smaller base image to run the application. We have also combined the `apk add` commands into a single command and removed the unnecessary `python3-pip` package. Finally, we have used the `--ignore-pipfile` flag with `pipenv install` to avoid installing `gunicorn`, which is no longer needed.

> I get the error The program 'tesseract' could not be executed or was not found on your system PATH.

1 / 1

The error message indicates that the OCR software `tesseract` is not installed or not available on the system PATH. To fix this error, you need to install `tesseract-ocr` in your Dockerfile.

Here's an example of how you can modify your Dockerfile to install `tesseract-ocr`:

Dockerfile

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim-bullseye

# Install OCRmyPDF and system dependencies
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get -y remove ocrmypdf && \
    apt-get -y install \
        ghostscript \
        icc-profiles-free \
        libxml2 \
        pngquant \
        tesseract-ocr \
        zlib1g

# Copy the Pipfile and Pipfile.lock to the container
COPY Pipfile Pipfile.lock ./

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir pipenv && pipenv install --system --deploy

# Copy the source code to the container
COPY app.py ./

# Expose the port for the Flask server
EXPOSE 8000

# Launch the Flask server
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

This Dockerfile installs `tesseract-ocr` as part of the system dependencies during the Docker build process.

> How can I still take advantage of the builder approach to minimize resulting docker image?

1 / 1

If you still want to take advantage of the builder pattern to minimize the resulting Docker image, you can split your Dockerfile into multiple stages. In the first stage, you can install all the necessary dependencies and build the application, and in the second stage, you can copy only the necessary files from the first stage and run the application. This way, you can keep the final image size small.

Here's an example of a Dockerfile using the builder pattern:

bash

```bash
# Build stage
FROM python:3.10-slim-bullseye as build-stage

# Install OCRmyPDF sys dependencies
RUN apt-get -y update && \
    apt-get -y remove ocrmypdf && \
    apt-get -y install \
        ghostscript \
        icc-profiles-free \
        libxml2 \
        pngquant \
        python3-pip \
        tesseract-ocr \
        zlib1g

# Copy the Pipfile and Pipfile.lock to the container
COPY Pipfile Pipfile.lock ./

# Install dependencies (OCRmyPDF and the web frontend ones)
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir pipenv && pipenv install --system --deploy

# Copy the source code to the container
COPY app.py ./

# Application stage
FROM python:3.10-slim-bullseye as app-stage

# Copy only the necessary files from the build stage
COPY --from=build-stage /usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages /usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages
COPY --from=build-stage /app.py /app.py

# Expose the port for the Flask server
EXPOSE 8000

# Launch the Flask server
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

In this example, the first stage is the build stage, where we install all the necessary dependencies, install the dependencies specified in the Pipfile, and copy the source code. In the second stage, we copy only the necessary files from the build stage, expose the port for the Flask server, and launch the server. This way, the final image only includes the necessary dependencies and the application, resulting in a smaller image size.

feat: Add Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml and update app.py

This commit adds a Dockerfile and a docker-compose.yml file to the project to allow for easy containerization and deployment of the OCRmyPDF API. The Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build approach to minimize the resulting image size. Additionally, the app.py file has been updated to explicitly set the host and port for the Flask server.

The docker-compose.yml file defines a service for the server, builds the Docker image and maps port 8000 to the host. The environment variables PYTHONUNBUFFERED and DEBUG are set to 1 for easier debugging.

Changes to be committed:

*   new file: Dockerfile
*   modified: app.py
*   new file: docker-compose.yml

Here's the updated form with a reset button:

php

```php
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <body>
        <form action='/ocrmypdf' method='post' enctype='multipart/form-data' id='ocr-form'>
            <input type='file' name='file' accept='.pdf' required>
            <p>Select OCR options:</p>
            <input type='radio' name='ocr_options' value='default' checked>Default<br>
            <input type='radio' name='ocr_options' value='skip_text'>Skip Text<br>
            <input type='radio' name='ocr_options' value='force_ocr'>Force OCR<br>
            <input type='radio' name='ocr_options' value='redo_ocr'>Redo OCR<br>
            <br>
            <input type='submit' value='OCR PDF'>
            <button type='button' onclick='resetForm()'>Reset</button>
        </form>

        <script>
            function resetForm() {
                document.getElementById("ocr-form").reset();
            }
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

This adds a new button that calls a JavaScript function to reset the form.

> 1 / 1

> Can you do this without javascript?

1 / 1

Yes, you can add a reset button to the form without using JavaScript by adding a simple HTML button with type attribute set to "reset" as shown below:

php

```php
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <body>
        <form action='/ocrmypdf' method='post' enctype='multipart/form-data'>
        <input type='file' name='file' accept='.pdf' required>
        <p>Select OCR options:</p>
        <input type='radio' name='ocr_options' value='default' checked>Default<br>
        <input type='radio' name='ocr_options' value='skip_text'>Skip Text<br>
        <input type='radio' name='ocr_options' value='force_ocr'>Force OCR<br>
        <input type='radio' name='ocr_options' value='redo_ocr'>Redo OCR<br>
        <br>
        <input type='submit' value='OCR PDF'>
        <button type='reset'>Reset</button>
        </form>
    </body>
</html>
```

The "reset" button will clear all the values in the form fields and reset the form to its original state.
